# Coding Challenges

## Coding Challenge 1 
### Start Polyglot Development with Autonomous Database
#### Objectives: 
This LiveLab will demonstrate how to provision an Oracle Autonomous Database and develop
applications in multiple programming languages.
* Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
* Develop Node.js Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database
* Develop Python Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database
* Develop Java Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database
* Develop .NET Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database

## Coding Challenge 2 
### SQL, JSON, and MongoDB API: Unify worlds with Oracle Database 23ai Free
#### Objectives: 
In this workshop, you will experience Oracle&#39;s JSON capabilities using both relational and document-store APIs, namely the Oracle Database API for MongDB.
The workshop loosely follows the Moviestreams theme, a series of workshops that demonstrate Oracle converged database capabilities. You will work on our movies library throughout the workshop.
* Store, query, and process JSON documents in collections using MongoDB API and
SQL/JSON
* Use SQL to query, generate, and process JSON data
* Configure the Mongo API to query or manipulate data in the Oracle Database
* Learn the newest SQL Enhancements to work with JSON data

## Coding Challenge 3 
### Develop with Oracle Database 23ai and GraalVM using Micronaut
#### Objectives: 
This workshop will walk you through the basics of developing with Oracle Database and GraalVM using Micronaut in order to get you up an running quickly with a data-driven microservice that connects to Oracle’s famous Autonomous Database.
* Explore the OCI console page of a, pre-provisioned, Oracle Autonomous Database
(ADB/ATP)
* Use the OCI console Cloud Shell terminal
* Download the wallet used to connect to the ATP instance
* Clone the Micronaut application source and configure the application to connect to the
ATP instance
* Install/configure GraalVM
* Build the application and native-image and run it to demonstrate connectivity to the
database from the Micronaut application.
* Develop new functionality of your own using this basic application/microservice
